Text Adventure Game

Text Adventure Game whereby the player is a student late for class and has to get to class.

A text adventure is a sort of interactive fiction that is entirely text-based. The world is presented in text and the way that the user interacts with the world is with natural language-like text. In the early days of computers where terminals and text-user interfaces (TUIs) were the norm, text adventures were one of the primary kinds of computer games that people played. In the modern age of computing, text adventures remain alive thanks to the dedication of smaller communities dedicated to developing quality text adventure games.
